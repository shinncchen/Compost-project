# Introduction
This project is a tutorial on building a compost temperature monitoring system with a Raspberry Pi. Micro-organisms consume organic material and oxygen and create heat as a waste product. By measuring this heat you can predict decomposition rate, oxygen content (loosely), and the overall health and efficiency of your composting operation.

# Part list
* Raspberry Pi
* Waterproof DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor
* 10K Precision Epoxy Thermistor 3950 NTC
* Phone line
* Capacitors

# Note
To create a new data set, you will need to create new node "article" in content.xml. Our current live project can be seen at moncompost.com.
